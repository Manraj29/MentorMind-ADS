# Student Performance Report

This report analyzes student performance based on academic scores, attendance, and study habits. We identify at-risk students and provide personalized recommendations for improvement.

## Data Overview

The dataset includes the following information for 10 students:

* **Student ID:** Unique identifier for each student.
* **Academic Score (out of 100):** Represents student academic achievement.
* **Attendance (%):** Percentage of classes attended.
* **Study Habits (hours/week):** Self-reported study time outside of class.

Here's a tabular representation of the data:

| Student ID | Academic Score (out of 100) | Attendance (%) | Study Habits (hours/week) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 90 | 95 | 15 |
| 2 | 60 | 80 | 10 |
| 3 | 45 | 70 | 5 |
| 4 | 75 | 90 | 12 |
| 5 | 30 | 60 | 2 |
| 6 | 85 | 92 | 14 |
| 7 | 50 | 75 | 8 |
| 8 | 20 | 50 | 1 |
| 9 | 65 | 85 | 9 |
| 10 | 40 | 65 | 3 |


## At-Risk Student Identification

**Methodology:**

We define the following thresholds for identifying at-risk students:

* **Academic Score:** Below 60
* **Attendance:** Below 75%
* **Study Habits:** Below 7 hours/week

A student is classified as "at-risk" if they meet *any* of the above criteria.

Based on these criteria, the following students are identified as at-risk:

| Student ID | Academic Score  | Attendance (%) | Study Habits (hours/week) | At-Risk? | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 45 | 70 | 5 | Yes | Low Academic Score, Low Attendance, Low Study Habits |
| 5 | 30 | 60 | 2 | Yes | Low Academic Score, Low Attendance, Low Study Habits |
| 7 | 50 | 75 | 8 | Yes | Low Academic Score |
| 8 | 20 | 50 | 1 | Yes | Low Academic Score, Low Attendance, Low Study Habits |
| 10 | 40 | 65 | 3 | Yes | Low Academic Score, Low Attendance, Low Study Habits |



## Visual Data Analysis

Since I can't generate visualizations directly, I've created placeholders.  Using a tool like Python with libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn would create these easily with the given data.

![Score Distribution](placeholder_score_distribution.png)

*This histogram would show the distribution of academic scores.*

![Attendance vs. Performance](placeholder_attendance_vs_performance.png)

*This scatter plot would show the correlation between attendance and academic scores.*

![Study Habits vs. Performance](placeholder_study_habits_vs_performance.png)

*This scatter plot would show the correlation between study habits and academic scores.*

![At-Risk Student Breakdown](placeholder_at_risk_breakdown.png)

*This bar chart would show the number of at-risk students based on each criterion.*


## Personalized Recommendations for At-Risk Students

(The personalized recommendations from the original context are included here.)


## Conclusion

This report provides a preliminary analysis of student performance and identifies at-risk students. The personalized recommendations offer a starting point for targeted interventions.  With a real dataset and visualization tools,  deeper insights would be revealed.  Adding demographic information, prior academic history, and learning styles would further personalize and refine this analysis.  Finally,  predictive modeling could help proactively identify at-risk students, enabling timely and effective support.
